## Data Types 
1. **Data Types**:
n Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable can only store a single type of data. That means itâ€™s important for you to learn to store the data correctly.
-There are different types of data that we can use in a JavaScript program. For example,
```
Example:
const x = 5;
const y = "Hello";
};
```
Here,

-5 is an integer data.
-"Hello" is a string data.
-**JavaScript Data Types**
There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. They are:

```
-Data Types	              Description	                                         Example
-String	           represents textual data	                                'hello', "hello world!" etc
-Number	         an integer or a floating-point number	                    3, 3.234, 3e-2 etc.
-BigInt	         an integer with arbitrary precision	                      900719925124740999n , 1n etc.
-Boolean	        Any of two values:true or false	                         true and false
-undefined	     a data type whose variable is not initialized	           let a;
-null	           denotes a null value	                                     let a = null;
-Symbol	       data type whose instances are unique and immutable	         let value = Symbol('hello');
