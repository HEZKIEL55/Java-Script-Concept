## Data Types 
1. **Data Types**:
n Javascript, there are five basic, or primitive, types of data. The five most basic types of data are strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, and null. We refer to these as primitive data types. A single variable can only store a single type of data. That means itâ€™s important for you to learn to store the data correctly.
-There are different types of data that we can use in a JavaScript program. For example,
```
Example:
const x = 5;
const y = "Hello";
};
```
Here,

-5 is an integer data.
-"Hello" is a string data.
